      Most of the animals received at Rabbit Rescue are in poor condition,
      malnourished, distressed, sick or injured. We provide veterinary
      treatment and the compassionate care needed to return them to good
      health. Some of the animals are the victims of deliberate cruelty and
      require long-term rehabilitation.
